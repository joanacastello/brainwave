# Brainwave ðŸ§ 

This website is a landing page for an AI service. It has different sections as Hero, Pricing, Services, Benefits... It has a modern design with animations to dive deeper into React and UX/UI concepts. It was developed following this [amazing tutorial](https://youtu.be/B91wc5dCEBA?si=zbCjvqE2ITUI5zNM).

This tutorial was followed to improve my abilities stack, in particular:
- React.
- Tailwind and CSS animations.
- UX/UI.
- Good practices.
